                <p class="course-description">
                    Krape Park Disc Golf Course, installed in 2003, is a 19 hole park-style course that flows through
                    beautiful Krape Park on the westside of Freeport, IL. Despite its beauty, it can pose a challenge
                    for all but the best of disc golfers! However, the course is still forgiving enough to be great
                    for people new to the sport or people that just enjoy throwing discs while taking a beautiful stroll
                    through the park. Krape Park has become the home of two area tournament: Krape Park Doubles Presented
                    by Kronk Disc Golf and the Krape Park Battle of the Birdies, a PDGA-sanctioned C-Tier event.

                <p class="course-description">
                    Krape Park Disc Golf course features several challenging wooded holes, holes with water hazards,
                    tight fairways, and has several holes that allow players to put a good rip on a disc. Hole 11 is 
                    the hole to watch for! At just 200 feet, it seems easy enough, but with a fairway covered in trees
                    and surrounded by out-of-bounds and thick brush, this hole can easily become a round-ruiner as well
                    as a disc eater.

                <p class="course-description">
                    The course offers multiple trash cans along the route, passes many benches and picnic tables, and has
                    easy bathroom accessibility for the 12 holes at the top of Flagstaff Hill. The bathrooms are most accessible
                    by holes 1, 7,8, and hole 9's teepad. Be aware that this is a multi-use park, so you may find cars parked near 
                    fairways, people picnicing in fairways, walkers walking on the walking paths on and near the course, 
                    people setting up to fish on the coure, and cars driving on the road that winds through the course.
